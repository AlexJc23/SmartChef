# Flask React Project

Setting up SmartChef environment  

## Getting started

1. Clone this repository (only this branch).

2. Install dependencies.

   ```bash
   pipenv install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Create a __.env__ file based on the example with proper settings for your
   development environment.

4. Make sure the SQLite3 database connection URL is in the __.env__ file.

5. This starter organizes all tables inside the `flask_schema` schema, defined
   by the `SCHEMA` environment variable.  Replace the value for
   `SCHEMA` with a unique name, **making sure you use the snake_case
   convention.**

6. Get into your pipenv, migrate your database, seed your database, and run your
   Flask app:

   ```bash
   pipenv shell
   ```

   ```bash
   flask db upgrade
   ```

   ```bash
   flask seed all
   ```

   ```bash
   flask run
   ```



7. To run the React frontend in development, `cd` into the __react-vite__
   directory and run `npm i` to install dependencies. Next, run `npm run build`
   to create the `dist` folder. The starter has modified the `npm run build`
   command to include the `--watch` flag. This flag will rebuild the __dist__
   folder whenever you change your code, keeping the production version up to
   date.
